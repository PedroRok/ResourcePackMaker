# Resource Pack Maker (RPM)

---

## Overview

**Resource Pack Maker (RPM)** is a user-friendly application designed for creating textures for all versions of Minecraft Java. Built using the Godot engine and C# for its core functionality, RPM simplifies the complex process of creating custom resource packs, including blocks, texts, items, and animations. Additionally, a future goal is to enable conversion to Bedrock Geyser.

## Origins

The idea behind RPM was born out of the challenges and complexities of managing resource packs in newer Minecraft versions. Organizing custom blocks, texts, items, and animations can be overwhelming. RPM aims to streamline this process by providing intuitive tools and workflows that make results both easy and efficient.
