# Resource Pack Maker (RPM)

## Overview

**Resource Pack Maker (RPM)** is a user-friendly application designed for creating textures for all versions of Minecraft Java. Built using the Godot engine and C#, RPM simplifies the complex and repetitive task of creating custom resource packs, including custom blocks, texts, items, GUIs, and animations. Additionally, a future goal is to enable conversion to Bedrock Geyser.

## Origins

The idea behind RPM was born out of the challenges and complexities of managing resource packs in newer Minecraft versions. Organizing custom blocks, texts, items, GUIs, and animations can be overwhelming. RPM aims to streamline this process by providing intuitive tools and workflows that make results both easy and efficient.

## Planned Features

- [ ] **Multi-Version Support:** Create resource packs for every version of Minecraft Java, each respecting its unique limitations.
- [ ] **Error Detection:** Automatically check your pack for errors and provide guidance for corrections.
- [ ] **Batch Operations:** Refactor files and add items in bulk to speed up your workflow.
- [ ] **Custom Glyph Creation:** Add to the game custom text glyphs and images.
- [ ] **Bedrock Conversion:** Convert resource packs to Geyser for Bedrock compatibility.
- [ ] **Automated Bedrock Icon Generation:** Create Bedrock icons automatically for custom modeled items.
- [ ] **Merge Packs**: Merge two different packs into one, displaying conflicts and resolving them.
- [ ] **Shader Options:** Customize shaders, including options for custom armor and chat text effects.
- [ ] **Mod Support:** Integrate with popular mods like Geckolib to enhance your resource pack creation experience.
- [ ] **Custom GUI Support:** Streamline the development of HUDs and GUIs by properly positioning and aligning them in-game (Using Glyphs).
- [ ] **Datapack Creation:** Automatically generate datapacks so you can test your resource pack directly in-game.

> *Additional features and enhancements will be added as the project evolves.*
